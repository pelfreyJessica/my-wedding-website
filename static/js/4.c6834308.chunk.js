Everyday in class I would get Taco Bell or Pizza Hut for lunch and eat it in the classroom (it was the fastest food to get on campus) and Grant always commented on my unhealthy eating habits. Even though it annoyed him, he must have seen something he liked, because come October he asked me out on a date. We got Hibachi and went to a movie.

Then he said "which is why I can\'t go another day without asking you this" and pulled a ring box out of his back pocket as he got down on one knee.
